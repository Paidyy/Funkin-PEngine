# Friday Night Funkin': PEngine
Engine made mainly to improve vanilla client and make modding easier and faster.
## Setting Shit up
1. Install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) and [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) or if you already have installed update Haxe and HaxeFlixel to latest version so it doesn't throw exceptions when compiling
2. Install these libraries using Command Line:
```
haxelib install flixel-addons
haxelib install flixel-ui
haxelib install hscript
haxelib install faxe
haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc
haxelib install openfl-webm
haxelib install yaml
haxelib install linc_luajit
haxelib install udprotean
haxelib git linc_clipboard https://github.com/josuigoa/linc_clipboard.git
```
3. And to compile just type ```lime test windows -debug``` or ```lime test windows``` in current folder command line

*Message to motherfuckers from gamaverse: this engine supports html5 partially, have fun on trying to ~~port~~ steal someone's mod to your garbage site <3*
